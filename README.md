## Overview

**eth-todo-list** is a decentralized application (DApp) that leverages Ethereum smart contracts to manage tasks. It integrates seamlessly with MetaMask for user authentication and transaction management. The application showcases a modern SaaS tech stack, utilizing React and Next.js for the frontend and Solidity for the backend.

### How it Works

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks that are securely stored on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Update Tasks**: Mark tasks as complete or update their status.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the blockchain.
- **View Tasks**: Fetch and display tasks from the blockchain.

## Features

- **Decentralized Task Management**: All task operations are handled by Ethereum smart contracts.
- **User Authentication**: MetaMask integration for secure user authentication and transaction signing.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with modern web technologies for a seamless user experience.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Next.js**: Framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **DaisyUI**: Tailwind-based component library for ready-made UI elements.

### Blockchain

- **Solidity**: Programming language for writing smart contracts.
- **Truffle Framework**: Suite for developing, testing, and deploying smart contracts.
- **Ganache**: Personal blockchain for local development.
- **Sepolia Testnet**: Ethereum testnet for testing smart contracts without real ETH.

### Deployment & Dev Tools

- **Vercel**: Platform for seamless deployment of Next.js applications.
- **MetaMask**: Browser extension for Ethereum wallet and blockchain authentication.
- **Web3.js**: JavaScript library to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mrmartin1998/eth-todo-list.git
    cd eth-todo-list
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start Ganache** (Personal Ethereum Blockchain):
    ```bash
    ganache-cli
    ```

4. **Deploy Smart Contracts**:
    ```bash
    truffle migrate --network development
    ```

5. **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

6. **Open in Browser**:
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## Usage

1. **Connect MetaMask**: Ensure MetaMask is set up with your local blockchain and has some test Ether.
2. **Manage Tasks**: Use the UI to add, update, and delete tasks. Confirm transactions in MetaMask to execute operations on the blockchain.
3. **View Tasks**: Fetch and display tasks stored on the blockchain.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates my ability to develop a full-stack decentralized application using modern technologies. It showcases my skills in smart contract development, blockchain integration, and building responsive web applications. Thank you for reviewing my project!
